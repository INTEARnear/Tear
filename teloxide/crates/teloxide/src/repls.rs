//! [REPL]s for dispatching updates.
//!
//! This module provides utilities for easy update handling. They accept a
//! single "handler" function that processes all updates of a certain kind. Note
//! that REPLs are meant to be used for simple scenarios, such as prototyping,
//! inasmuch they lack configuration and some [advanced features].
