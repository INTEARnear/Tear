/// Automatic request limits respecting mechanism.
///
/// Telegram has strict [limits], which, if exceeded will sooner or later cause
/// `RequestError::RetryAfter(_)` errors. These errors can cause users of your
/// bot to never receive responses from the bot or receive them in a wrong
/// order.
///
/// This bot wrapper automatically checks for limits, suspending requests until
/// they could be sent without exceeding limits (request order in chats is not
/// changed).
///
/// It's recommended to use this wrapper before other wrappers (i.e.:
/// `SomeWrapper<Throttle<Bot>>` not `Throttle<SomeWrapper<Bot>>`) because if
/// done otherwise inner wrappers may cause `Throttle` to miscalculate limits
/// usage.
///
/// [limits]: https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq#my-bot-is-hitting-limits-how-do-i-avoid-this
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// ```no_run (throttle fails to spawn task without tokio runtime)
/// use teloxide_core::{adaptors::throttle::Limits, requests::RequesterExt, Bot};
///
/// let bot = Bot::new("TOKEN")
///     .throttle(Limits::default());
///
/// /* send many requests here */
/// ```
///
/// ## Note about send-by-@channelusername
///
/// Telegram have limits on sending messages to _the same chat_. To check them
/// we store `chat_id`s of several last requests. _However_ there is no good way
/// to tell if given `ChatId::Id(x)` corresponds to the same chat as
/// `ChatId::ChannelUsername(u)`.
///
/// Our current approach is to just give up and check `chat_id_a == chat_id_b`.
/// This may give incorrect results.
///
/// As such, we encourage not to use `ChatId::ChannelUsername(u)` with this bot
/// wrapper.
